Image plotter for MTSAT-2
=========================

This python program is able to plot the IR data retrived from MTSAT-2.

For more details on this piece of data, read
[this](ftp://mtsat-1r.cr.chiba-u.ac.jp/readme.txt). This is a detailed
explanation of data structure, the meaning, etc.

The plotter adds coastlines using data from [Nature Earth
Data](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/10m-coastline/).

And the data is at the end shown using PIL(Python Image Library)'s `equalize`
method, to edit the contrast.
